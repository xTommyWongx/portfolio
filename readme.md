# My personal portfolio

### Header
- Navbar uses Bootstrap navbar, when scroll down 100px, it becomes transparent in black color in background
- The sentence 'LET'S BUILD SOMETHING AMAZING AND CODE TOGETHER' uses `setTimeout` to trigger the animation and sparking shawdon effect.
- The buttom also set animation effect

### Photo share section
- The photos use animation with hinge out effect with `Animation.css` when the photo clicked
- The photos grid uses bootstrap grid system- 

My learning journey and blog sharing section also uses the same animation effect with `Animation.css` effect
